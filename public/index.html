                    25 paper bags of produce to friends and family. Our business grew and we quickly became the produce
                    delivery service of choice to over 400 happy families in the Triangle. We brought the freshest
                    fruits and veggies to them, and they enjoyed the ease of living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
                <p class="text-right">When Hurricane Michael destroyed our facility, we made the choice to pivot and
                    provide fruit to incredible corporate offices around the Triangle. Now that we (and the world) are
                    faced with another unforeseen crisis, we’re coming back to our roots, serving families with the most
                    basic need: fresh food to eat.</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>How is your produce different from what’s in the grocery store?</dt>
                    <dd>Choosing The Alexander Fruit Company means you get the freshest and highest-quality fruits and
                        veggies, chosen by an expert just for you. Plus, you don’t have to go to the grocery store or
                        worry about all the hands that touched that apple you’re eating. Win-win.</dd>
                    <dt>How often do we get our delivery?</dt>
                    <dd>We bring your produce to you every Thursday, unless you want to skip a week (that’s fine by
                        us!).</dd>
                    <dt>Where do you deliver?</dt>
                    <dd>We will deliver to Raleigh, Durham, Cary, and Knightdale and a bit beyond. Any deliveries past
                        our range would incur a small ($5) delivery fee.</dd>
                    <dt>Am I locked into a contract?</dt>
                    <dd>Nope. You can cancel your weekly membership at any time (although we doubt you’ll want to!) by
                        letting us know by the Sunday before midnight of the week you’d like to cancel.</dd>
                    <dt>Are there any extra fees?</dt>
                    <dd>No sign up fee. No delivery fee in our main delivery areas. No confusing deposits or surcharges.
                        Just the price of your perfectly picked produce package.</dd>
                    <dt>Can I customize my package?</dt>
                    <dd>For now we don’t offer customized packages.</dd>
                    <dt>Can I skip a week?</dt>
                    <dd>You can skip any week by emailing us at ned@alexanderfruit.com before Sunday at midnight. SKIP
                        requests received after Sunday at MIDNIGHT automatically become part of our Give program. This
                        means we discount your package $10 and donate your produce to a local family in need since we
                        have likely already bought your food from our all-star farmers & vendors.</dd>
                    <dt>Is this organic?</dt>
                    <dd>We love to include some local and/or organic options when they’re available at the farmer’s
                        market, but our biggest priority is top-tier, delicious produce at an unbeatable price.</dd>
                    <dt>What kind of fruits and veggies will I get?</dt>
                    <dd>The variety will change week-to-week depending on what’s available at the farmers market. Some
                        items will be staples like leafy greens, root veggies, onions, apples and bananas. But many
                        items will change weekly to keep your meals interesting.</dd>
